#### How to make it portable

This presumes your camera is working with Windows native drivers. If you need to install drivers too, this is not what you are looking for. 

1. Scroll all the way down and download the [version LWS 2.80 \(or just click here\)](http://www.logitech.com/pub/video/lws/lws280.exe)
2. Unpack the file `lws280.exe` using the UniExtract app \(find it in this page\)
3. Inside the unpacked folder, find the file`SharedBin\LWS_SharedBin_Installer_x86.exe`
4. Unpack `LWS_SharedBin_Installer_x86.exe` , and it will give you the folder with the portable app.
5. Run the file `LogiDPPApp.exe` to start the app.
